    <h1>Dragon Roll ドラゴンロール</h1>

    <p>Next to California Rolls, Dragon Roll is another popular sushi roll served at American-style sushi restaurants and buffet joints. It’s not traditional sushi you can find in Japan, but I can see why this imaginative sushi is such a favorite.
    The combo of creamy avocado and crunchy shrimp tempura make the perfect match to the tenderly moist vinegared rice. It’s so delicious that I can devour the entire roll on my own. Luckily, making dragon roll at home is easier than it looks.</p>
    <p>The dragon roll is an inside-out sushi, which is filled with nori sheet wrapping around the ingredients on the inside and the sushi rice is on the outside. Here, shrimp tempura and cucumber are tucked inside the nori, and thinly sliced avocado is layered on top of the roll, and when it’s sliced, the artistically arranged sushi resembles the scales of a dragon. The sushi roll is typically topped with tobiko fish roes and drizzled with spicy mayonnaise and unagi sauce, which makes it even more enticing.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Japanese or Persian cucumber (</li>
            <li>2 avocados</li>
            <li>½ lemon</li>
            <li>2 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) </li>
            <li>2 cups sushi rice (cooked and seasoned)</li>
            <li>8 pieces Shrimp Tempura (homemade or store bought)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp tobiko (flying fish roe)</li>
            <li>unagi (eel)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>For the Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spicy Mayo (homemade)</li>
            <li>Unagi Sauce (homemade or store bought)</li>
            <li>toasted black sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>For the Vinegar Water for Dipping Hands</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>2 tsp rice vinegar (unseasoned)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Cut the cucumber lengthwise into quarters. Remove the seeds and then again cut in half lengthwise into thin strips. You will have 8 strips.</li>
            <li>Cut an avocado in half lengthwise around the pit and twist the two halves until they separate. Use a spoon to remove the pit. Alternatively, you can remove the pit with your knife, but you must take great care not to use too much force or you could cut your hand. First, hold the avocado half in your palm; it's best to hold it with a folded kitchen towel to protect your hand. Next, very gently tap the heel of your knife into the pit with just enough pressure that the knife embeds in the pit. Then, twist the knife and the pit will come out smoothly. Repeat with the remaining avocado.</li>
            <li>Remove the skin and thinly slice the avocado halves crosswise.</li>
            <li>Gently press the avocado slices with your fingers so the individual slices begin to slide and separate. Keep pressing gently and evenly with the side of the knife until the length of the sliced avocado half is about the length of a sushi roll (or a sheet of nori seaweed.) If you don't serve the sushi roll right away, I recommend squeezing lemon over the avocado to prevent discoloration. Repeat with the other avocado halves.</li>
            <li>Line the bamboo mat with plastic wrap and place half of the nori sheet on top, shiny side down. Dip your hands in the tezu (vinegar water) and spread ½ cup sushi rice over the nori sheet.</li>
            <li>Flip over the nori sheet with the rice on it. Place two pieces of the shrimp tempura, two cucumber strips, and some tobiko at the bottom end of the nori sheet closest to you.</li>
            <li>From the bottom end, start rolling the nori sheet over the filling tightly and firmly with the bamboo mat until the bottom edge reaches the nori sheet. Lift the bamboo mat and roll over the remaining nori.</li>
            <li>Place the bamboo mat over the top and tightly squeeze the roll.</li>
            <li>Remove the bamboo mat and plastic wrap from the sushi roll. Using the side of the knife, lift the avocado slices from one half and place them on top of the roll. If you'd like to use unagi, alternate avocado and unagi slices and layer them to cover the top and sides of the roll.</li>
            <li>Replace the plastic wrap over the roll and put the bamboo mat over the top. Tightly squeeze the roll through the bamboo mat until the avocado slices wrap around the roll. Be gentle so you don’t break the avocado slices. Remove the mat.</li>
            <li>Cut the roll through the plastic wrap into 8 pieces with the knife. Clean your knife with a wet towel after each cut. If the roll gets messy while cutting, tightly squeeze the sushi roll again with the bamboo mat. Remove the plastic wrap on top of the sushi and transfer the sushi pieces to a serving plate. Repeat to make the remaining rolls.</li>
            <li>Put some tobiko on each piece of sushi and drizzle spicy mayo and sprinkle black sesame seeds on top. If you'd like, place some unagi sauce on the plate so you can dip the sushi. Enjoy!</li>
